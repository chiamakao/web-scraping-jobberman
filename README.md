# Web Scraping Featured Jobs on jobberman.com
Jobberman is a popular online jobs platform in Nigeria that connects qualified professionals to their dream jobs and employers to the best talent. Over 2 million people each year use jobberman to find jobs. The website homepage has a clean layout where job seekers can search for a job based on different categories. For each category, various jobs are featured.For example the Sales category, has different roles like Sales Manager, Investment Advisor and Sales Representative.

In this project, we retrieved information from the job category Accounting, Auditing & Finance, using a technique called web scraping.

Here's an outline of the steps we followed.

* Download the webpage using Requests
* Parse the HTML source code using Beautiful Soup
* Extract featured jobs from each job category
* Compile extracted information into Python dictionaries
* Extract and combine data from multiple pages
* Save the extracted information to a CSV file
